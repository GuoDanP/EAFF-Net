Our Work
Edge-Attention and Feature Fusion Network for Difffcult Polyp Segmentation
Abstract
Accurate polyp segmentation is key to early detection and prevention of colorectal cancer. Many
U-Net variants have been proposed and successfully applied to polyp segmentation. However, the
segmentation effect of these methods on the newly proposed Kvasir-Sessile dataset is not ideal. There
are three limitations, insufffcient handling and utilization of edge information in polyp images, prone
to losing small polyp objects, and deffciencies in the methods of feature enhancement and fusion. To
alleviate these challenges, we propose an edge-attention and feature fusion network (EAFF-Net) to
accurately segment ffat and sessile polyps. Edge-Attention Module (EAM) utilizes reverse attention
and the prediction conffdence of the previous layer as guidance to focus on difffcult regions and
pay more attention to edge information. Through the Fusion Attention Module (FAM), the decoder
features and the output features of EAM are cross-fused to further fflter and enhance the features.
This method has good segmentation performance for difffcult polyps. Extensive experiment results
with eight state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on four public polyp datasets, especially on the KvasirSessile
 dataset.
